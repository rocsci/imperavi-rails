# Imperavi for Rails 3.1+ (still under development)

What is Imperavi? Imperavi is open-source, lightweight and really pretty-looking wysiwyg editor written with JQuery. Look at the demo page: http://imperavi.com/redactor/examples/ (sorry for Russian). Like it?

I created this mountable engine with Imperavi so now you can easily integrate this editor into your app.

## Installation

Put this line into your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'imperavi-rails', '0.0.5.beta'
```

Then mount the engine in routes.rb:

```ruby
mount ImperaviRails::Engine => "/imperavi"
```

add this line to `config/environments/production.rb`

```ruby
config.assets.precompile += ['imperavi-rails/imperavi/redactor.css', 'imperavi-rails/imperavi.js']
```

And you're done!

## Usage

Add this helpers into the your view that contains a form:

```erb
<%= include_imperavi_stylesheet %>
<%= include_imperavi_javascript %>
<%= imperavi :page_article %>
```

In this example `page_article` is an id of textarea field. You can pass additional options to `imperavi` helper as second argument. See the full list of options here: https://github.com/tanraya/imperavi-rails/blob/master/app/helpers/imperavi_rails/imperavi_helper.rb#L35

You may want the text on your page to be styled the same way as it looks in the editor. To do this, add the following styles into your `application.css.scss` (provided that the text on the page is enclosed with `article` tag):

```scss
@import "imperavi-rails/imperavi/imperavi-base";

body {
  width: 700px;
  margin: 0 auto;

  article {
    overflow: hidden;
    @include imperavi-base;

    p, div {
      border: 0;
    }

    p {
      padding: 0;
      margin: 0 0 1.5em 0;
    }
  }

  form {
    textarea {
      width: 700px;
      height: 600px;
    }
  }
}
```

## Deal with images

Uploading images is not part of the imperavi-rails. You have to implement this functionality in your application yourself. It's easy. Read the docs below.
